I made this repository for my CSE 445 (Distributed Systems) Assignment 4 at Arizona State University. 
In this assignment, I pursued validation of XML data alongside XSD schema execution and conversion of verified XML structures into JSON format by employing C# language. 
The program verifies two XML files including one valid and another invalid file through schema validation before it uses the Newtonsoft.Json library to convert the valid XML into JSON format. 
The entire program logic exists in 'submission.cs' and all XML and XSD files can be accessed from GitHub through their raw URL endpoints. 
Working on this assignment allowed me to develop skills in XML validation and schema definition as well as data conversion through which I achieved full success on the Gradescope tests.
